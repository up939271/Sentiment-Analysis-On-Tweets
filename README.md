# Sentiment-Analysis-On-Tweets
Performing Sentiment Analysis on Streamed Tweets Using Python
I streamed tweets from Twitter on Boris Johnson during the COVID-19 Pandemic to ascertain what people were saying about him 
and what emotions they had behind the tweets. 

The coding has been done on Python 3.65 using Jupyter Notebook. This program fetches LIVE data from TWITTER using Tweepy. Then I clean the data or tweets ( like removing special characters ). After that we perform sentiment analysis on the twitter data.
